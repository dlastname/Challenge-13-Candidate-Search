## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```
npm install
```
Ensure you have a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) set up to increase the API rate limit. The .env file should contain your GitHub token.

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, run the application using the following command:

npm run start

The candidate search page will load, displaying information about a candidate, including:

- Name
- Username
- Location
- Avatar
- Email
- HTML URL
- Company

You'll be able to:

- Save a candidate by clicking the "+" button, adding them to the list of potential candidates.
- Reject a candidate by clicking the "X" button, moving to the next candidate without saving.
- View the list of potential candidates with their details.

When there are no more candidates, the app will display an appropriate message indicating the end of available candidates.
